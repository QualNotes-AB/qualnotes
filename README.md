Digital qualitative research on your mobile device

try the beta preview here: https://qualnotes.github.io/#/


## Purpose

The QualNotes app is designed to capture, record, edit and annotate field-based research.

The app has three key research portals:
1. mobile mapping
2. interviews and focus groups, and,
3. participant observation and auto-ethnography.

Each portal combines and integrates the materials
necessary for undertaking common qualitative research methods into one platform.

## Roadmap

- image capture;
- video and audio recording;
- file repositories for research documentation including
- ethics consent form integration and management;
- collaboration and sharing capability;
- sketch and doodle options;
- and, GPS-based mobile mapping.

## Audience

It is designed for qualitative researchers in field-based disciplines including human geographers,
sociologists, anthropologists, urban planners, and design thinkers. Alongside the research functionality, QualNotes is an ideal teaching tool for students learning qualitative methods. The collaborative function enables student group work, but also opportunity
for critical reflection on the ‘how-to’ components of teaching research methods. QualNotes provides a platform for students to practice research methods, and for teachers to use the students’ data to facilitate critical reflection on data generation and analysis too.

## About
It is designed by qualitative and design thinking researchers to capture, record, edit and annotate
